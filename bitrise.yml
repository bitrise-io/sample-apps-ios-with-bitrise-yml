      This is a utility workflow, used by other workflows.
    steps:
    - git::https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-certificate-and-profile-installer.git@master:
        description: |-
          This step will only be used in CI mode, on continuous integration
          servers / services (because of the `run_if` statement),
          but **NOT** when you run it on your own machine.
        run_if: .IsCI
        inputs:
        - keychain_path: $BITRISE_KEYCHAIN_PATH
        - keychain_password: $BITRISE_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD

    steps:
    - xcode-test:

        - scheme: ${XCODE_PROJECT_SCHEME}

      This workflow will run Xcode archive on this project,
      but first it'll run the workflows listed in
      the `before_run` section.

    - test

      This workflow is meant to be used on a CI server (like bitrise.io), for continuous
      deployment, but of course you can run it on your own Mac as well,
      except the Step which deploys to Bitrise.io - that's marked with
      a Run-If statement to be skipped, unless you run bitrise in --ci mode.
    before_run:
    - archive
    steps:
    - script:
        inputs:
        - content: |-

          The long `run_if` here is a workaround. At the moment Bitrise.io
          defines the BITRISE_PULL_REQUEST environment
          in case the build was started by a Pull Request, and not the
          required PULL_REQUEST_ID - so we'll check for that instead.
        run_if: 'enveq "BITRISE_PULL_REQUEST" "" | and .IsCI'
        inputs:
        - notify_user_groups: none
        - is_enable_public_page: "yes"
